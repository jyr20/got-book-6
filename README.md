# Shakespeare Sonnet Generator

Based on got-book-6 generator (https://github.com/zackthoutt/got-book-6).

Use neural networks to write a shakespeare sonnet, albeit ignoring some of the sonnet rules. The results can be found in /poems.

The steps are shown in the Jupyter notebook, which is then broken into 2 python scripts: train.py (which loads data and trains) and write.py (which uses the trained model to write a "poem").

Sample:

"*As to thee as your beauty;
but in my summer sail of me my lie.
What from this to all thy days than with their show;
when freezings is tenure of the beauty; be suns of thee defeated on that thee most,
dost my will that separable did live.*"

It kind of makes sense maybe? Good fun either way.
